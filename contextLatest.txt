ISSUE: Shopify API Initialization Build Error
- Error: "Cannot initialize Shopify API Library. Missing values for: apiSecretKey, hostName, apiKey"
- Location: /api/hello route build failure
- Root Cause: Shopify API was being initialized at module load time with empty fallback strings when env vars are missing

FIX APPLIED:
1. Modified `web/lib/shopify/initialize-context.ts`:
   - Changed from eager module-level initialization to lazy singleton pattern
   - API now only initializes when first accessed via `getShopify()` function
   - Added proper error handling with descriptive message for missing env vars

2. Updated all consuming files to call `getShopify()` function:
   - `web/lib/shopify/verify.ts`
   - `web/lib/shopify/register-webhooks.ts`
   - `web/lib/shopify/gdpr.ts`
   - `web/lib/get-products.ts`
   - `web/app/api/webhooks/route.ts`

RESULT: Build now succeeds ✓
- Compiled successfully in 24.7s
- All routes generated correctly including /api/hello and /api/webhooks
