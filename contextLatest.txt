[2025-12-10T17:06:50 EST] Fixed Vercel Build Configuration Error
-----------------------------------------------------------------
ISSUE: Build error "Failed to collect page data for /api/hello"
CAUSE: vercel.json was pointing to "next.config.js" at the root directory, but the Next.js app is in the "web/" subdirectory.

CHANGES MADE:
- Updated vercel.json to configure:
  - "framework": "nextjs"
  - "buildCommand": "cd web && pnpm install && pnpm run build"
  - "outputDirectory": "web/.next"
  - "installCommand": "pnpm install"

FILES MODIFIED:
- vercel.json
